chiffrement : cipherable 

simple encryption<br />
<u>**zig 0.11.0**</u><BR />
<br />

**TESTING** <br />
*look at the bottom of the testing page* <br />

<br />
Encrypt and decrypt study:<br />
function encrypt: key 10 char, includes char \n and char " " (10 32) the whole thing includes an algorithm.<br />
language mixing contributes to undecipherable<br />
<br />
function decrypt = reverse encrypt<br />
<br />
everything is encoded to accept UTF8<br />
it is always possible to break the undecipherable, but to encrypt a Json file containing a structure relating to a display???,<br />
it is rather to discourage when porting an application.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, we can multiply the keys etc. .<br />
it would be possible to only encrypt every 2 characters...this is not included in the program, but the program is just a basic cipherable study<br />
<br />
the key can contain UTF8 characters<br />

In the test, all that remains is to include an integrity check key
