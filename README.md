Encrypt and decrypt study:<br />
encrypt: key 10 char, includes char \n and char " " (10 32) the whole thing includes an algorithm.<br />
language mixing contributes to encryption<br />
<br />
decrypt = reverse encrypt<br />
<br />
Afterwards, we can multiply the keys etc. .<br />
This program is related to encryption, it has two keys, one for the text and one for control. The control key keeps track of the number of encrypted characters.<br />  
<br /> 
This encryption is designed to discourage unauthorized access when implemented for a client. I make no claims that it is unbreakable.<br /> 
<br />
the key can contain UTF8 characters<br />

Have fun deciphering without looking at the program.<br />  
  
  
It is possible with this principle to include the encryption key in the encrypted file. This key would be generated based on the date and time. Once you understand the program, you will understand what I'm saying.<br />
